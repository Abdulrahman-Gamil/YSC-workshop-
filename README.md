## CTF Hacking Essentials Workshop Write-ups

We are excited to announce that the write-ups for all the challenges hosted in the **CTF Hacking Essentials** workshop by the **Yemeni Student Community at APU** are now available! This workshop aimed to introduce participants to the fascinating world of Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions, a cornerstone of the cybersecurity community.

### About the Challenges

The challenges were thoughtfully designed to cater to beginners, focusing on simplicity and clarity. By solving these challenges, participants gained hands-on experience in fundamental CTF concepts, ranging from cryptography and web exploitation to reverse engineering and forensics. Each challenge was crafted to be engaging, educational, and a stepping stone to understanding the broader scope of cybersecurity.

### Purpose of the Workshop

The primary goal of the workshop was to demystify the concept of **CTF competitions** and highlight their importance in the cybersecurity domain. By participating in this practical experience, students learned:

- How to approach CTF challenges methodically.
- The significance of critical thinking and problem-solving in cybersecurity.
- How CTFs serve as an excellent platform to build and refine skills.


Happy hacking!
